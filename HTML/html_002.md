# HTML tags

Any content item to be displayed in the page should be concluded inside a HTML element so that the browser will understand what kind of content it is. 

For example we can have paragraphs, headings, images, lists, etc...

The syntax for the most tags is that we have an opening and closing tag with the content inbetween, like so:

```html
<p>I am just a paragraph of text. I have to be inside the <p> tag </p>
```
