# HTML

> What is it? 

HTML is a markup language used to lay out the content elements and help browser to understand how to render them. 

Every item of content should be "described" for the browsers in a semantic way -- we have to tell what kind of item it is, like paragraph, heading, list, image, quote, etc.

HTML is a set of elements or tags which we use to achieve that goal.

When we start building the webpage we wrap every content item into the corresponding element telling browser exactly what kind of content we have. 

Why do we need to do so? Because otherwise, unlike humans, browsers can not really understand what content we want to render (display in the page). 

So HTML is the language behind every webpage, all the elements of content we see in the browser when we visit any website are rendered from the HTML markup.
